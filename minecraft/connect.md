# Connecting to a Server
> ⚠ **You must be registered on the ZeroTier network to join.** See how to join in [Configuring ZeroTier](https://drop8k.github.io/docs/misc/zerotier.html).

- Launch Minecraft. Go to ***Multiplayer*** > ***Add Server***
   - **Make sure you are running the correct version of the game, and with the correct modpack (if applicable).**
- Under ***Server Address***, paste a server IP provided by the administrator. Click ***Done***.
   - **Your client should be able to ping the server, and the MOTD will show up under the name if the address is correct.**
   - *If it does not show up, make sure you've inputted the correct address and that your ZeroTier is properly configured.*

> ⚠ **Note that cracked launchers can only play on servers in offline mode.** *Servers with online mode enabled can only be played on official Minecraft accounts.*

You can find a list of available server IPs from the [Minecraft](https://drop8k.github.io/docs/minecraft/main.html) page or in supported Discord servers.

## Troubleshooting
Confirm you have verified all of the following:

- The server is active and running
- The correct Minecraft version and modpack (if applicable)
- [Additional or updated mods](https://drop8k.github.io/docs/minecraft/extras.html) required by the server
- An official or cracked Minecraft account
- Proper [ZeroTier network configuration](https://drop8k.github.io/docs/misc/zerotier.html)
