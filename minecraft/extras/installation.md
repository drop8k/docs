# Installing Extra Mods

## Windows

- Locate your Minecraft installation folder.
   - Curseforge: In the launcher, go to ***Minecraft*** > ***My Modpacks*** and locate your modpack. Right-click on the modpack > ***Open Folder***.
      - You may also manually navigate to this folder. The default directory is `C:\Users\<your_name>\curseforge\minecraft\Instances\`.
