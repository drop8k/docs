# Installing Modpacks Using CurseForge App (Windows)
Modpacks can be installed conveniently and easily using the CurseForge mod launcher.

This guide is for Windows operating systems.

- [First-Time Setup (CurseForge)](https://drop8k.github.io/docs/server/installation1.html#first-time-setup-curseforge)
- [Downloading Modpacks](https://drop8k.github.io/docs/server/installation1.html#downloading-modpacks)
- [Uninstalling Modpacks](https://drop8k.github.io/docs/server/installation1.html#uninstalling-modpacks)

## First-Time Setup (CurseForge)
> *If you have CurseForge configured already, you can skip to [Downloading Modpacks](https://drop8k.github.io/docs/server/installation1.html#downloading-modpacks).*

- Download [CurseForge](https://download.curseforge.com/) and run the installer.
   - **CurseForge requires [Overwolf](https://www.overwolf.com/) to be installed.** *If you do not have Overwolf installed, the setup will install it for you.*

- Launch the application. Create a new Minecraft installation folder using CurseForge, or manually set your folder. *Note that all Minecraft modpacks installed with CurseForge will be located in this directory.*
   - **Create a new Minecraft installation folder.** If CurseForge does not detect your existing installation, or you wish to create your own, you can get CurseForge to make a new one.
     - Head to ***Settings*** > ***Game Specific*** > ***Add*** > ***Minecraft*** > ***Add Minecraft (Java Edition)***.
     - The default installation folder created by CurseForge is located under `C:\Users\<your_name>\curseforge\minecraft`, with `<your_name>` being the name of your user folder. *If you want to select a different folder or drive, select **Advanced**.*

## Downloading Modpacks
Modpacks can be installed by browsing the CurseForge website or using the CurseForge app. 

**It is recommended to use the website, as you can be sure you are installing the correct pack.** *However, the app is an option if you are comfortable with using it., and may be easier to some users.*

### Using the CurseForge Website
- Launch the [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks) website for Minecraft modpacks. *You may also receive a direct link to the modpack instead; open or paste this link in your browser.*
- Install modpacks using the **Install** button. It should automatically launch CurseForge and begin installation.

- Alternatively, you may wish to install a specific or older version of a modpack by clicking on the modpack's details > ***Files*** > ***Recent Files*** > ***View All***.

## Adding Profiles to Launcher

### CurseForge (Official)
By default, CurseForge will automatically make profiles for your modpacks.

- In the launcher, go to ***Minecraft*** > ***My Modpacks***. Hover your mouse over the modpack you want to launch and press ***Play***.

### SKLauncher: Method 1 (Recommended)
- Download the [SKLauncher](https://skmedix.pl/sklauncher) executable and save it to a directory. `.jar` versions will not work.
- Locate the Minecraft installation folder created by CurseForge and navigate to `Install`.
   - By default, CurseForge places it under: `C:\Users\<your_name>\curseforge\minecraft\Install`, replacing `<your_name>` with the name of your user folder.
- Delete/rename the `minecraft.exe` file found in `Install` (e.g. `minecraft.exe.bak`). Then, drag the SKLauncher executable (e.g. `SKlauncher_3-beta.21.exe`) into the directory and rename it to `minecraft.exe`.

   - test

## Uninstalling Modpacks
- To uninstall a modpack, open the CurseForge app and head to the left sidebar. Select ***Minecraft*** > ***My Modpacks***. Click on the modpack > ***3 Dots*** > ***Delete Profile***.
