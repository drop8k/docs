1. Download [Curseforge](https://download.curseforge.com/) and run the installer.

2. Launch the application. Create a new Minecraft installation folder using Curseforge, or manually set your folder. *All Minecraft modpacks will be installed in this directory.*
   - **Create a new Minecraft installation folder.** If Curseforge does not detect your existing installation, or you wish to create your own, you can get Curseforge to make a new one.
     - Head to ***Settings*** > ***Game Specific*** > ***Add*** > ***Minecraft*** > ***Add Minecraft (Java Edition)***.
     - The default installation folder created by Curseforge is located under `C:\Users\<your_name>\curseforge\minecraft`. *If you want to select a different folder or drive, select **Advanced**.*
