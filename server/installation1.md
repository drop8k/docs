# Installing Modpacks Using CurseForge (Windows)
Modpacks can be installed conveniently and easily using the CurseForge mod launcher.

> This guide assumes you have a legitimate copy of Minecraft Java Edition.

## First-Time Setup (CurseForge)
> *If you have CurseForge configured already, you can skip to [Browsing Modpacks](https://drop8k.github.io/docs/server/installation1.html#browsing-modpacks).*

- Download [CurseForge](https://download.curseforge.com/) and run the installer.
   - **CurseForge requires [Overwolf](https://www.overwolf.com/) to be installed.** *If you do not have Overwolf installed, the setup will install it for you.*

- Launch the application. Create a new Minecraft installation folder using CurseForge, or manually set your folder. *All Minecraft modpacks will be installed in this directory.*
   - **Create a new Minecraft installation folder.** If CurseForge does not detect your existing installation, or you wish to create your own, you can get CurseForge to make a new one.
     - Head to ***Settings*** > ***Game Specific*** > ***Add*** > ***Minecraft*** > ***Add Minecraft (Java Edition)***.
     - The default installation folder created by CurseForge is located under `C:\Users\<your_name>\curseforge\minecraft`. *If you want to select a different folder or drive, select **Advanced**.*
